Hypothesis testing:

Let's assume we are tossing a coin there are two situations for the coin

H0 is a fair coin
H1 or Ha is not a fair coin

Our goal is to assess and come to decision is about one of the above is true

Null Hypothesis: We assume H0 is correct 

you toss a coin

first result -> tail - prob(0.5)
second result -> tail - prob(0.25)
thrid result -> tail - prob(0.12)
fourth result -> tail - prob(0.06)
========================================= this is significance value alpha(Î±) = 0.05
fifth result -> tail - prob(0.03)
sixth result -> tail - prob(0.015)

after you seeing the 5th result you can say with 95% confidence we can reject hypothesis H0
